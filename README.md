This is my Data Representation and Querying Project
The app is called opinionate. 

CREATE PAGE
============
On the create page you can create your own comment. It requires you give it a title and then content for the post
When you are ready to post it you click the "create comment" button and it will be shown on the List page

LIST PAGE
===========
On the list page you can scroll down through all of the previously created comments similarly to a forum.
On each comment you can edit,delete or like the comment. The number of likes is shown on each post at the like button.
They can be liked by clicking on the button which gets updated on the click.

EDIT PAGE
===========
The edit page is very similar to the create page. It allows you to fix any grammar issues or edit the title and the content.
Once you have edited the comment you can re-post it by clicking the "update comment" button and all likes the comment had will remain on the post.

POPULAR PAGE
============
The popular page shows the top 3 posts with the most amount of likes in order from highest to lowest going down the page.
likes cannot be added to posts on this page as it is strictly for viewing the posts and not for engaging with the comments in anyway. 
If you wish to like,delete or edit the comment you can return to the List page by clicking the button under the Header of the page.

All pages can be accessed by clicking on the buttons under the header except for the edit page which requires you to click on the "edit" button on a comment.
This is because this feature requires you to already have a post you wish to edit, so is tied in with the comment as a button.
On the popular page if two comments have the same amount of likes they will be ordered by whichever comment was there first.
